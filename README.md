# MultinomialMixtureModel

This is my repository for my implementation of a mixture of multinomials model. The mixture of multinomial model is used to model user ratings of movies in the MovieLens dataset.

###Packages used:
- Numpy
- Scipy

###Structure:
- a3p1.py - python script that processes the dataset and perform experiments.
- MultinomialMM.py - python funtions that implements the mixture of multinomial model and Expectation-Maximization.
- utils.py - misc. python functions for data-processing, data-cleaning.
